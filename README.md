**Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI**
Experience the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in a smarter way! This Python implementation allows you to play against an intelligent AI that uses the Minimax algorithm to always make the best possible moves. Whether you are a beginner or a Tic-Tac-Toe enthusiast, this game offers a fun and challenging experience.

**Features**

Human vs AI: Play against a computer opponent.
Smart AI: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
Win/Draw Detection: The game accurately detects wins, losses, and draws.
Interactive Interface: Simple and easy-to-use interface for smooth gameplay.

**Installation:**
1) Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Chaitu475/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
2) Navigate into the project folder: cd Tic-Tac-Toe
3) Run the game: javac *.java and  java Main

   
**How It Works**

The game board is a 3x3 grid where players take turns placing their mark (X or O).
The AI evaluates all possible moves using the Minimax algorithm and selects the move that maximizes its chances of winning.
The game ends when either the player or AI wins, or when the board is full resulting in a draw.

**Challenges Solved**

Efficient AI: Implementing the Minimax algorithm to ensure optimal AI performance without slowing down the game.
Game Logic: Correctly managing the game state and detecting end conditions.
User Experience: Creating an intuitive and interactive interface for seamless gameplay.
